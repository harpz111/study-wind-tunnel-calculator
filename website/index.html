      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        This tool implements a simplified, physically consistent method for preliminary sizing of open-circuit,
        low-speed wind tunnels. All tunnel sections are defined relative to the test section, which acts as the
        reference for flow conditions, loss coefficients, and power scaling.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a specified test-section Mach number and geometry, the method propagates flow conditions upstream and
        downstream through the contraction and diffuser. Section-by-section losses are computed using empirical
        correlations from the wind tunnel design literature and combined into a single total loss coefficient.
      </p>

      <p>
        The total loss coefficient defines an energy ratio which links test-section dynamic pressure to overall tunnel
        pressure losses. This enables a consistent estimate of required fan/motor power for a given test-section
        condition.

      <h2>Method</h2>

      <p>
        The tunnel is modelled as three primary sections:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Contraction</li>
        <li>Test section</li>
        <li>Diffuser</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For each section, the local Mach number, Reynolds number, and Darcy friction factor are evaluated from the
        local cross-sectional area and length. Loss coefficients for the contraction, test section, and diffuser are
        then computed using established empirical correlations. All losses are referenced to the test-section dynamic
        pressure and summed into a single total loss coefficient for the tunnel.
      </p>

      <p>
        The energy ratio is defined as the inverse of the total loss coefficient and is used to estimate total pressure
        drop and motor power required to achieve the specified test-section conditions.
      </p>

    <section id="assumptions">
      <h2>Model assumptions</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Low-speed, open-circuit configuration (subsonic; intended for modest Mach numbers).</li>
        <li>Losses are referenced to test-section dynamic pressure for consistent summation.</li>
        <li>Friction factors and loss correlations are empirical and represent engineering approximations.</li>
        <li>Steady flow assumption; does not model unsteady effects, fan curves, or acoustics.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <hr>

    <section id="use">
      <h2>Intended use</h2>

      <p>
        This tool is intended for rough preliminary sizing only. It is suitable for early-stage feasibility studies,
        comparison of candidate tunnel geometries, and estimation of overall tunnel length/footprint and
        order-of-magnitude fan power requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is aimed at students, hobbyists, and academic users who want a transparent sizing calculation based on common
        wind tunnel design relations.

    <section id="limitations">
      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Does not include screens/honeycombs, corners, inlet/exit losses, or facility-specific ducting effects.</li>
        <li>Does not include fan performance curves, motor selection, noise, or structural constraints.</li>
        <li>Boundary-layer blockage is treated using simplified correlations and should be checked for validity.</li>
        <li>Not a substitute for detailed CFD, structural design, or experimental validation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="references">
      <h2>References</h2>

      <p>
        The method is based on standard low-speed wind tunnel design texts and supporting technical reports, including
        empirical loss correlations for contractions and diffusers. A full reference list will be provided once the tool
        and accompanying documentation are finalised.
