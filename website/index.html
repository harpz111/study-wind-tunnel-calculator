        Preliminary sizing method for open-circuit, low-speed wind tunnels.

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        This tool implements a simplified but physically consistent method for the
        <em>preliminary sizing of open-circuit, low-speed wind tunnels</em>.
        All tunnel sections are defined relative to the test section, which serves as
        the reference for flow conditions, loss coefficients, and power scaling.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a specified test-section Mach number and geometry, the method propagates
        flow conditions upstream and downstream through the contraction and diffuser.
        Section-by-section losses are evaluated using empirical correlations from the
        wind-tunnel literature and combined into a single total loss coefficient.
      </p>

      <p>
        The total loss coefficient is used to define an energy ratio, which provides a
        direct link between test-section dynamic pressure and the overall pressure
        losses of the tunnel. This allows the required fan power to be estimated in a
        consistent and transparent manner.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="method">
      <h2>Method</h2>

      <p>
        The tunnel is modelled as three primary sections:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Contraction</li>
        <li>Test section</li>
        <li>Diffuser</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For each section, the local Mach number, Reynolds number, and Darcy friction
        factor are evaluated based on the local cross-sectional area and length.
        Loss coefficients for the contraction, test section, and diffuser are then
        computed using established empirical correlations.
      </p>

      <p>
        All losses are referenced to the test-section dynamic pressure, allowing them
        to be summed into a single total loss coefficient for the tunnel. The energy
        ratio is defined as the inverse of this total loss coefficient and is used to
        estimate the total pressure drop and motor power required to achieve the
        specified test-section conditions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="use">
      <h2>Intended use</h2>

      <p>
        This tool is intended for <strong>rough preliminary sizing only</strong>.
        It is suitable for early-stage feasibility studies, comparison of candidate
        tunnel geometries, and estimation of overall tunnel length, footprint, and
        order-of-magnitude fan power requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tool is aimed at students, hobbyists, and academic users who wish to explore
        the implications of test-section requirements on overall tunnel sizing using
        standard relations from the wind tunnel design literature.
      </p>
    </section>

    <hr>

    <section id="limitations">
      <h2>Limitations</h2>

      <p>
        The model does not include losses associated with screens, honeycombs, corners,
        fan performance curves, inlet or exit effects, acoustic considerations, or
        structural constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        Boundary-layer blockage is treated using standard empirical correlations and
        should be checked against their stated validity limits. The tool does not
        replace detailed CFD analysis, structural design, or experimental validation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <hr>

    <section id="references">
      <h2>References</h2>

      <p>
        The formulation implemented in this tool is based on standard low-speed wind
        tunnel design textbooks and supporting technical reports, including empirical
        loss correlations for contractions and diffusers.
      </p>

      <p>
        A full list of references will be provided once the tool and accompanying
        documentation are finalised.
